# Binary Tree Visualizer

## Description

This project is a visual learning tool designed to help students understand binary trees, particularly the different traversal types (preorder, inorder, postorder, and level-order).

I created this tool to provide an easy-to-use visual representation that illustrates how binary trees are structured and how traversals work.

Although not perfect, it effectively serves its educational purpose.

## Objectives

- Help students grasp the concepts behind binary trees.
- Visually demonstrate various tree traversal methods.
- Provide an interactive and easy-to-use interface.
- Serve as a practical educational aid in computer science courses.
